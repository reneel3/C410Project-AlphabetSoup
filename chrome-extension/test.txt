Pie, glorious pie! There are few desserts I love more on this whole planet the pie (other than a good chocolate cake of course!). I‚Äôve shared most of my favorite pie recipes with you, including my Grandma‚Äôs Lemon Chiffon Pie, and Chocolate Cream Pie. We can probably all agree that Pumpkin Pie is the most iconic of Thanksgiving desserts. I‚Äôve tried so many different recipes and I just love the simplicity and perfect taste and texture from the traditional Libby‚Äôs pumpkin pie recipe. It‚Äôs been tried and tested by millions of people to be the best pumpkin pie recipe! You can jazz it up by serving a slice with a spoonful of warm, delicious caramel pecan topping.\xa0There‚Äôs no pie that deserves ‚ÄúQueen Bee‚Äù status more! Combine: Beat the eggs and canned pumpkin puree together. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to the pumpkin mixture. Add Evaporated Milk: Evaporated milk could be substituted with half and half or cream. Bake: Pour into an unbaked pie shell and bake at 425 degrees F for for 15 minutes, to set the crust, then reduce temperature to 350 and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until set. Make Caramel Pecan Topping (optional): I like to make a simple Caramel Pecan Topping for guests to spoon over their slice of pie, if they‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs made in about 5 minutes, in a saucepan with brown sugar, whipped cream, corn syrup, butter, pecans and vanilla extract. I‚Äôve included the full recipe in the notes of the printable recipe card. To Make Ahead:\xa0You can make the entire pumpkin pie recipe from scratch the day before and store it the refrigerator, or prepare the pie crust and filling the day before and store them separately in the refrigerator until ready to bake the next day. To Store: Store-bought pumpkin pie can sit at room temperature because of the preservatives added, but homemade pumpkin pie should be refrigerated if not eaten within 2 hours of sitting out.\xa0 Leftover pumpkin pie will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.\xa0 Be sure to allow pumpkin pie to cool completely and then cover it loosely with plastic wrap, for storing. To Freeze: A fully cooked pumpkin pie can be frozen for up to 3 months. Allow it to cool completely, then cover it with a layer of plastic wrap and then a double layer of aluminum foil.\xa0 Freeze for up to 3 months. You can also freeze the pie crust for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving. Follow me for more great recipes Recipe Did You Make This Recipe? Tag @TastesBetterFromScratch on Instagram with #TastesBetterFromScratch!

The pie was so silky, creamy, and not overly sweet! I wanted to add the pecan topping, but lacked patience to make it separately, so I mixed maple syrup, cinnamon, and chopped pecan bits in a bowl, then drizzled it onto the uncooked pie filling and swirled it in. It made the pie HEAVENLY.\nI can‚Äôt wait to make this recipe again, and I will definitely make 2 pies, since it was a crowd pleaser.

Lauren Allen Published on October 16, 2021 It‚Äôs easy to make your own Pumpkin Puree from pure pumpkin, that‚Äôs much superior to the canned stuff. Freeze it for use in any recipe! Looking for more pumpkin recipes? Try my Pumpkin Cake, Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread, or Pumpkin French Toast! Wash Pumpkin(s). Cut the stem off, slice in half (lengthwise), and place on a sheet pan with parchment paper. Remove seeds from inside the pumpkin and use them to roast pumpkin seeds, or discard them. Bake at 375 degrees F with pumpkin halves cut side down on baking sheet. Bake 35-45 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender when pierced with a fork. Scoop flesh out of the shells and place it in a food processor or blender. Blend just until smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of water, if needed. Use puree in place of ‚Äúcanned pumpkin puree‚Äù in any recipe, or store for later! Baking Pumpkins are best for making pumpkin puree. They give the best texture and are naturally sweeter. These are usually called ‚Äúsugar pumpkins‚Äù or ‚Äúpie pumpkins‚Äù.  The taste of these pumpkin will be much more flavorful than a large ‚Äúcarving‚Äù pumpkin, but you can use a large pumpkin if it‚Äôs all you can find. The USDA does not recommend home canning pumpkin puree, so I can‚Äôt recommend that you preserve this recipe in jars. You can read more here. Place rack or steamer basket in the bottom of the pressure cooker. Add one cup of water to the bottom. Cut off pumpkin stem and place the whole pumpkin on the rack. Cook on high pressure for 13 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes. Remove rack with pumpkin on it and let cool for 15 minutes. Slice pumpkin in half and remove seeds.

But it tastes terrible.  I bought ‚Äúpie pumpkins‚Äù from my local supermarket, but either they aren‚Äôt true pie pumpkins or they weren‚Äôt ripe or something.  I‚Äôm so disappointed.  Is there a way to recognize a proper pie pumpkin and whether it is fully ripe?  My puree is more yellow than the standard orange Libby‚Äôs canned pumpkin.\n Unfortunately, I‚Äôll be using canned pumpkin to make my Thanksgiving pie tomorrow.  Sigh. Butternut squash can also be used in place of pumpkin, that‚Äôs what you get in stores anyway when you buy pumpkin puree I made this for my pumpkin pie with sugar pumpkins but I was wondering do you let it cool before you scrape out the inside? I have always wanted to try this, and with some extra pumpkins I had around, I finally decided to try it. It was so much easier than I thought and the flavor was incredible.

The BEST tender, buttery, and flaky pie crust recipe, and it‚Äôs so easy! Looking for more pie crust recipes? Try my Oreo Pie Crust or Graham Cracker Crust! Combine Ingredients: Start by adding the flour and salt to a mixing bowl, then add the cold shortening and butter. Cut Fats into Flour: Use a pastry blender or forks to cut the fats into the flour until the mixture resembles crumbs. Add Moisture: Add some ice water, just one tablespoon at a time, until the mixture starts to come together into a ball. (You may not need all of the ice water). Form into Ball: The dough should not be sticky, be careful not to over-work it. Handle the dough just enough to form it into a ball. Divide into two equal pieces and flatten each into a disc. Refrigerate/Freeze: Cover the dough well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. Place the wrapped disc of dough in a freezer ziplock bag and freeze for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using. Prepare: Find a large, thin hand towel or cloth and get it barely damp. Lay on countertop and place a large piece of parchment paper over it. (The damp cloth will keep the parchment paper from sliding around as you roll out your pie dough). Remove pie dough from fridge and dust both sides with a little bit of flour. Place on parchment paper. Roll Out: Use your rolling pin to gently press the pie dough out into a large circle.\xa0Always start at the center of the crust and work outwards. You want your crust to be thin, and a at least 1or 2 inches larger then the size of your pie tin. Transfer into Dish: Place pie pan next to the rolled out pie crust. Lift the crust placing a hand underneath the parchment paper and gently flip the crust, guiding it into the pie pan. Settle the crust into the bottom and sides of the pan, then gently peel the parchment paper off. Trim and Crimp Crust: Leave 1 inch overhang of excess crust around the edges, and use a butter-knife or kitchen scissors to trim anything larger. Fold the excess crust behind the outer edges to create a thicker crust border. Crimp or flute the edges, if desired. Fill or Bake: At this point you can proceed and pie filling that requires baking (like pumpkin pie) and bake according to recipe instructions. Or, blind bake the pie crust to use in pie recipes that call for a pre-baked pie crust (like a pudding pie or this lemon sour cream pie). Why do I need pie weights? When blind-baking your crust, always use pie weights! You can use dry beans, dry rice, or pie weights. Pie weights help the pie crust to keep its shape. If you bake your crust without pie weights you risk the crust shrinking and shriveling down into the bottom of the pan. Fill with Pie Weights: Place a large piece of parchment paper inside unbaked pie crust. Pour some dry beans, rice, or pie weights onto the parchment paper and smooth into an even layer. Bake at 375¬∞ F for 15-20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and lift the parchment paper and weights out of the crust. Prick the the bottom of the crust all over with a fork, then return the pie to the oven to bake until lightly golden, about 10-15 more minutes. To freeze pie crust dough: Prepare the pie dough, wrap the dough discs tightly in plastic wrap and place in a freeze ziplock bag.\xa0 Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in refrigerator before rolling out. To freeze unbaked pie crust: roll out pie crust and place in a freezer safe pie dish. Cover well and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before filling or baking. To freeze baked pie crust: Allow blind baked pie crust to cool completely. Cover well and freeze for up to 3 months.

I love the texture you achieve with the mixture of butter and shortening. Absolutely will make again! I used the dough right away this time. Will have to trial it after freezing next time! I love how easy the instructions are! Great tips. The best part is all the recipes you have for fillings! Can I just skip the pie weights and insert immediately the cake mix inside the pie crust  and then bake straight until both (pie crust and cake mix) are ready? YUM, YUM, YUMMMM!!! This recipe is amazing! I hadn‚Äôt made pie crust from scratch in 10 years because it was just such a frustrating endeavor. But the damp towel and parchment paper is the trick I had been missing, and the flipping it over literally changed my life. Taste-wise, I thought it was too salty though. Next time I will cut the salt down and add some sugar. Still giving this recipe 5 stars since lots of people like a little salt to counter sweet pie fillings. This has become my go-to pie recipe. The dough rolls out easily and is easy to transfer. It bakes perfectly. From frozen works just as well. I decided to try this pie crust recipe after 5 years of using my go-to recipe and I think I‚Äôve been convinced to switch! I loved working with this dough much more than the one I had been doing before, and it worked so well with my pie. This was a super easy recipe! I love how there are the instructions on how to freeze it 3 different ways! Thank you!

The TBFS Cookbook', 'title': 'Perfect Pie Crust'}, 'https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/apple-pie/': {'recipe': 'Tastes Better From Scratch Home ¬ª Dessert Lauren Allen Published on November 8, 2022 An easy Apple Pie recipe with step-by-step photos and tips for making homemade apple pie filling and apple pie crust (either traditional or lattice). This pie is the ultimate crowd pleaser, and just can‚Äôt be beat! Do you love pie recipes as much as I do? Try my Lemon Sour Cream Pie, Triple Berry Pie, or Pumpkin Cheesecake! Choose tart apples for apple pie, and I always like to use more than one type of apple, to add variety of flavor. My go-to for apple pie is a combination of granny smith and honey crisp apples. I also like to use Janagold (a cross between Jonathan and Golden Delicious) or Northern Spy (red and green apple in season October/November and thought of as the perfect Apple Pie apple). Prepare Apples: Peel, core, and cut apple slices. (I use a johnny apple peeler to make this process extra easy as it does it all in one). Make sure your apple slices are cut relatively thinly. Combine Spices: Whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt and ¬æ cup sugar, then set aside. Coat Apples: Melt butter in a large\xa0saut√©\xa0pan/skillet over medium-high heat then add the apples to the skillet and stir them to coat them in butter. Immediately add the spice and sugar mixture, stirring to coat the apples. Cook Apples: Lower heat to medium then cook the apple mixture for 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour and cornstarch over the apples and stir well to coat. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Optional: Pour the mixture out onto a baking sheet to allow it to cool quicker, while you prepare your pie crust. Add to pie crust: Add cooled pie filling into a pie dish with a cold, unbaked pie crust in it. Add top crust: Cut the top crust into a few strips, to add a pretty lattice crust, or place the whole pie crust on top of the pie, and cut a few slits on top for seam to escape. Brush lightly with an egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Leave the pie in the oven and reduce temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake for 30 to 40 more minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool:\xa0Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool completely, at least 2-3 hours. This allows the filling to set up so it wont fall apart when slicing. For best results, store baked apple pie on the counter for a day or in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. To Make Ahead: The pie dough can be made several days in advance, or frozen for months ahead of time. The pie filling can be made a day ahead, stored in a covered container in the fridge. The entire pie can also be made a day ahead of time. Once cool, cover and refrigerate. To Freeze: The pie crust and apple pie filling can be frozen, separately, for up to 3 months. Thaw completely in the fridge and then assemble. Baked apple pie can also be frozen once it has cooled completely. Cover it well with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw for about 1.5 days in the refrigerator before serving.

Hi Lauren! I‚Äôve tried so many of your recipes and love them all! I‚Äôve never commented before, but just had to tell you that I made this apple pie today for one of our residents at work turning 103 that wanted apple pie for her bday. There was a big celebration and pie competition with 12 pies entered‚Ä¶and I WON! Never saw that coming as a first time pie maker. Baking another ‚Äúaward winning‚Äù pie tomorrow for friends in town! Thank you for all the great recipes and fun inspiration. How amazing! Thank you so much for commenting to let me know‚Äìand way to go! Thanks for the support <3 Fantastic!  This pie was the best I‚Äôve ever had.  I‚Äôve always been intimidated by pies, but this recipe was easy and delicious.  Thank you! My husband said it was the best apple pie he‚Äôs tasted. Everyone agreed this pie was delicious! I love this apple pie recipe! It has a lot more flavor than the one I‚Äôve been using for years. I also love that the filling stays in place when you cut into it! The apple pie was absolutely delicious, I made it the day before my family‚Äôs thanksgiving feast and it sat out on the counter teasing us but we resisted cutting into it but nibbled away on the crust, so good! Awesome apple pie.\nReplaced the majority of regular granulated sugar with a slightly reduced amount of Splenda for a Reduced Sugar Apple Pie variation & my family raved about the new pie recipe. Honestly, this was the best pie I‚Äôve had in a really long time. I think this is the best pie I ever made.  I have tried so many recipes.   I love baking but pies are hard for me.  My 14 year old and I  just made for the 4th of July.  We used the lattice and it seems less soupy.   The pie crust came out perfect.  I put in the fridge but impatient so I put in freezer for 30 minutes.   I used extra cinnamon and added cardamon instead of the other spices since its summer.  And I used 1 tbs less flour when precooking the apples.  I forget the apples were cooking and the apples sauce turned into a wonderful carmel.   I think I am also impatient when cooking my filling so it was good to see what it should look like.   I was hard to wait 2 hours but when it was pie time we ate it up!  The next day, we ate the rest for breakfast.  The pie filling wasn‚Äôt everywhere and stayed in place.     The apples were not too firm or soft.  I used a variety including green apples.  This will be my go to recipe.  I look forward to making the pie crust ahead of time.   Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe. Lauren, I have to tell u that this hands down the best apple pie recipe that I have ever found. I don‚Äôt care what any of these other people say about ur recipe not working, it must be operator error because it is perfect. I discovered ur crust recipe a year or so ago and it is awesome, especially after u get the feel down. In addition, I have made ur cherry, pumpkin and lemon meringue and they r always good. In fact, I am currently peddling pies in North Central Montana, all from ur recipes and doing well with rave reviews. I told my wife the other day that if I ever met u I would give u a huge hug and a üíã! Thanx so much for the awesome recipes.

It‚Äôs every chocolate lover‚Äôs dream! Homemade pies are kinda my favorite thing ever! My mom and grandma taught me how to make homemade pie crust when I was really young, and every Thanksgiving since I can remember I was assigned to make Lemon Chiffon Pie and at least one other favorite pie recipe.\xa0 I LOVED it, and they loved the extra help. <img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-full wp-image-23944 aligncenter" src="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-8.jpg" alt="A slice of chocolate cream pie with whipped cream and chocolate curls on top, on a white plate with a fork." width="750" height="1125" srcset="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-8.jpg 683w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-8-150x225.jpg 150w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-8-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> This Chocolate Cream Pie is PERFECT in so many ways! It‚Äôs perfect for any time of year (even summer time, if you‚Äôre looking for an (almost) no bake chocolate pie recipe!). It‚Äôs perfect in the way it holds together. Unlike so many pudding pies you may have attempted in the past, this Chocolate Cream Pie will hold together perfectly.

Set aside to cool. Make the chocolate pudding filling: Add the sugar and milk to a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently. Add the egg yolks and cornstarch to a bowl and whisk until smooth. Once the saucepan mixture is simmering, add a few spoonfuls of the hot liquid into the egg yolks and whisk to temper the eggs. Slowly whisk the tempered egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan. Whisk constantly until the mixture begins to thicken and comes to a very gently boil (big bubbles begin to break the surface). Remove pan from the heat and stir in the butter, chopped chocolate, and vanilla extract. Stir well until completely smooth. Pour filling into the cooled crust and smooth into an even layer. Place a piece of plastic wrap gently on top and refrigerate until filling is set, at least 4‚Äì6 hours. <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-23961 aligncenter" src="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-13.jpg" alt="Four process photos for making chocolate pudding pie filling, including a spoon pouring hot milk into whisked egg yolks in a bowl, a saucepan with pudding filling, chopped chocolate, butter and vanilla, a spoon lifting the pudding filling from the saucepan, and the filling poured into a pie dish with an Oreo pie crust in it." width="750" height="1100" srcset="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-13.jpg 698w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-13-204x300.jpg 204w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-13-150x220.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> Once the pudding filling has set, top with fresh whipped cream and chocolate curls or shavings. <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-23948 aligncenter" src="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie.jpg" alt="A clear glass pie pan with oreo crust and chocolate cream pie in it, next to another photo of a spatula spreading whipped cream on top of the pie." width="750" height="500" srcset="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie.jpg 750w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> I use both egg yolks and cornstarch to thicken the chocolate pie filling in this recipe. The egg yolks get tempered and added to the hot pudding filling, helping to thicken it. The cornstarch adds an additional thickening agent to help the pie set up even better. The result is a chocolate pie filling that holds together perfectly, but still has a smooth and creamy texture. Yes! This pie would taste delicious with a traditional Pie Crust (be sure to blind bake it first), or a graham cracker crust. I love the extra ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that chocolate curls add when I use them to decorate the top of this pie! I‚Äôve tried a few different methods, and here‚Äôs the easiest method I‚Äôve found: Melt 1 cup of good quality chocolate. I use Ghirardelli baking chips or a bar of Baker‚Äôs chocolate, chopped. You can make your own double boiler to melt the chocolate (it‚Äôs very easy!), or follow my tips for melting chocolate in the microwave. Pour melted chocolate onto the back of a baking sheet and smooth it into a thin layer. I use an offset spatula to smooth the chocolate into as thin of a layer as I can. <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-23949 aligncenter" src="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Curls.jpg" alt="Melted chocolate being poured onto the back of a baking sheet, next to a photo of the chocolate being smoothed into a thin layer with an offset spatula." width="750" height="500" srcset="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Curls.jpg 750w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Curls-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Curls-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> Allow the chocolate to set. My biggest tip for making chocolate curls is making sure the chocolate is the right consistency. Place the baking sheet with melted chocolate in the fridge for about 5 minutes, or in the freezer for 2-3 minutes. Use a metal spatula or scraper to make the chocolate curls. Remove the pan of chocolate from the fridge or freezer. Allow it to rest on your counter for a minute or two. Hold your metal spatula horizontally in front of you and press it firmly against the pan at a 45 degree angle, scraping the chocolate up as you push the scraper forward. If the chocolate is set right it will begin to curl over itself as you push. If the chocolate shreds into tons of small pieces instead of folding into a curl, it‚Äôs probably too cold, so allow it to come to room temperature a little longer. If the chocolate pulls up from the pan limp and wont curl, it is too soft, so return it to the fridge for 30 seconds to 1 minute to allow it to set up more. <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-23957 aligncenter" src="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-3.jpg" alt="A hand holding a metal scraper to scrape chocolate up from a baking sheet to form chocolate curls." width="750" height="1125" srcset="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-3.jpg 683w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-3-150x225.jpg 150w, https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chocolate-Cream-Pie-3-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> You can make this pie 1-2 days ahead of time.

It‚Äôs rich, smooth, and tastes incredible on my homemade pie crust and served with sugared cranberries and whipped cream. Pumpkin cookies, pumpkin bars, pumpkin lattes, pumpkin cupcakes, pumpkin bread, pumpkin cake, and pumpkin Bundt cake, but HELLO what about pumpkin pie?? My Great Pumpkin Pie Recipe is here today. Did you know that testing the perfect pumpkin pie recipe is a lot more challenging than one would assume!? Fresh pumpkin, canned pumpkin, ginger, no ginger, brown sugar, white sugar, cornstarch, flour, no cornstarch, no flour‚Ä¶? But I finally I cracked the pumpkin pie code. I grew up in a house of pumpkin pie lovers and absolutely no Thanksgiving was complete without a nap and a massive slice of pumpkin pie. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, my pumpkin pie standards are high for this classic Thanksgiving dessert. Let‚Äôs start with the pie crust. Every pumpkin pie has to start with a stellar pie crust. My homemade pie crust uses a mix of shortening and butter so you get the most buttery tasting, tender, flaky (so flaky) pie crust. It‚Äôs easy to make. And I have a video tutorial and step-by-step photos in my pie crust recipe. If you skip the leaf decorations on top, you‚Äôll have a 2nd pie crust you can use to make leftover turkey pot pie or mini pecan pies! Or if you like extra thick pie crust, use some of your 2nd pie crust to make a decorative crimped or fluted edge. My how to crimp and flute pie crust tutorial will walk you through all the steps. I tested this recipe with both and I truly liked the pie using canned pumpkin better. The canned pumpkin pumpkin pie (say that 3 times fast) was a little more sturdy when baked for the same amount of time. The pie baked with fresh pumpkin puree tasted grainy and a little‚Ä¶\xa0herbaceous? I prefer using fresh pumpkin puree in savory recipes, not desserts. This is your call, you can use either fresh or canned pumpkin. This sounds so incredibly weird, but I add freshly ground black pepper to my pumpkin pie filling. It‚Äôs bizarre, I know. But I‚Äôm being serious. I got this tip from the genius kitchen crew over at King Arthur Baking. And I am forever grateful. Because this little addition turns your pumpkin pie into the BEST pumpkin pie. No one will know it‚Äôs there except for you. And they will all be wondering what makes this spiced pie so good‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a pinch of pepper. I actually add it to my homemade pumpkin pie spice blend, too! Feel free to replace the ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and black pepper below with my homemade spice. (Keep the cinnamon in the filling though!) Silky yet\xa0thick, this pumpkin pie cuts beautifully as long as it is baked for the right amount of time. The bake time is about 55-60 minutes. At this time, the center of the pumpkin pie will be slightly wobbly. It will set as it cools. Careful not to overcook; overcooking it will cause the filling to crack. P.S.: For some fun twists on this classic, try this recipe as mini pumpkin pies, with a crunch topping on pecan praline pumpkin pie, or with extra spices in chai pumpkin meringue pie. You can also make a pumpkin cheesecake pie! So from my kitchen to yours, enjoy The Great Pumpkin Pie Recipe. And if you‚Äôre looking for more inspiration for your dessert table, here are all of our favorite Thanksgiving pies and a list of 30+ pumpkin dessert recipes. Bursting with flavor, this pumpkin pie recipe is my very favorite. It‚Äôs rich, smooth, and tastes incredible on my homemade pie crust and served with whipped cream. The pie crust leaves are purely for decor, you can leave those off of the pie and only make 1 pie crust. You can also leave off the sugared cranberries. Keywords: pumpkin pie My pie crust recipe makes enough for two crusts. So with the extra dough, you can make adorable leaves for decoration on your pumpkin pie. Or any pie, really. I‚Äôve seen the pie crust leaves baked directly on top of the rim of the pie‚Äîand I tried that‚Äîbut was not thrilled with the results. Too much uneven baking. The underside of the leaves weren‚Äôt really cooked through and the tops got a little burnt (even through my pie shield). So, to make things easier, just bake the pie crust leaves separately and place them on top of your pie before serving. You can also sprinkle them with a little cinnamon-sugar right before baking. I was going to do that, but I forgot. My leaf cookie cutters (affiliate link) don‚Äôt have ‚Äúveins‚Äù so I made leaf veins myself using a sharp paring knife. It‚Äôs tedious, but if you want authentic looking leaves you can go ahead. Don‚Äôt worry if your veins aren‚Äôt perfect. That‚Äôs a\xa0weird sentence. My directions\xa0for the leaves are in\xa0the print-out recipe above. My team and I love hearing from you! Submit your question or recipe review here.

I have made 4 of these pies so far . They are really great ! The best spicy pumpkin pie ever ! Excellent. Used 3 tsp Trader Joe‚Äôs pumpkin pie spice and it was perfect. Light consistency. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Best pumpkin pie ever. Everyone loved it. Thank you ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ The flavor of this pie is excellent and it was demolished by our Thanksgiving guests!  Don‚Äôt skip decorating with the sugared cranberries and pastry leaves- there are cutters sold online that put the veins and leaf shapes together in a simple stamp.  A few comments that would have made it better (because I didn‚Äôt do everything as precisely as I should): be certain to REALLY fill the empty crust with beans before you pre-bake it  (I didn‚Äôt have enough weight and the crust puffed up in 2 areas) and I also used dark corn syrup, making the pie filling so dark that it appeared to be overcooked, not a good look.  This would be a perfect pie but I don‚Äôt think the oven timing is accurate for most ovens.  I keep a separate thermometer in my ovewn to be sure it is baking at the temp I set- in the case of this pie, leaving it in at 375 for 50 minutes was a little too long and made the pie firmer than I would have liked.  If I had left it any longer, it would have been ruined.  All in all, wonderful recipe though‚Ä¶ ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ I liked the flavor, but hardly anyone at the party did. I guess they like the Libby‚Äôs recipe better. Is it possible to not use a bottom crust? I love the leaves, but the crust was still soggy. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Hi Gayle, you can skip the bottom crust. The pie‚Äôs (with the filling) bake time will be about the same. Or you can try a graham cracker crust, or a Biscoff cookie crust. This is my favorite Pumpkin Pie filling recipe. The taste and texture are perfect, absolutely perfect. I love that I can easily make it lactose free by simply using lactose free (cow‚Äôs) milk ‚Äî heavy cream is already lactose free ‚Äî and it‚Äôs so much better with the fresh cream and milk instead of canned anyway! I love the texture of this pie so much. Can you please recommend other pie recipes that have this same texture? Or could I simply substitute an equal amount of another fruit‚Ä¶like peaches? ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Hi Catherine! Many of my cream or custard pies will have a similar texture. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed this! This is my new go-to pumpkin pie filling recipe from here on out!  I love the level of sweetness and level of spices.  Much better than the recipe on the back of the can I usually use.  But the most amazing part, par-baking the crust!  I never knew you had to do that (or could/or should) for custard pies, but it is a total game-changer!  The bottom of the crust is delightfully crispy and chewy!  Thank you so much Sally! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ I absolutely love this pie recipe! It comes out perfectly every time and no electric mixer is required. It was a real fluke that I found this recipe. My mother, her mother and her mother‚Äôs mother all used cann milk. But not having any, I looked for one using whipping cream that I had for Alfredo sauce recipe. It was so good that I actually purchased baking weights so my crust would be as perfect as the filling! So glad I found it! Loved by all, especially my husband. And I always put a scoop of pumpkin minus sugar and spice for our Scotty. She loves it too! ‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ I‚Äôve been making this recipe for a few years now and everyone always loves it. The proportions of spices is just lovely. This year I got to share it with my new in-laws in Norway and it was their first time having pumpkin pie, they were thrilled. Now I‚Äôm being asked to bring it to another family gathering tonight, I‚Äôd be very happy if this becomes what I‚Äôm known for around here. This was my first pumpkin pie and it was delicious. Everyone at Thanksgiving was complimentary including my picky husband. I used Sally‚Äôs pie dough recipe too and it was very good and I am sure with a few more tries I will get it down to look pretty as well. Thank you! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ I‚Äôve made pumpkin pies for decades and none have been as good as this. The frosted cranberries and little pastry leaves were a superb addition. The Homemade Pie Dough was amazing too. We had some leftover filling and baked it in ramekins. Excellent all around. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ This Pie was a total failure!  The pumpkin filling curdled, and the top was very weird looking.  The picture of your pie is rather glossy, but mine was anything but.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing different is I didn‚Äôt whisk by hand but in the mixer.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it ended up in the garbage and I had to buy one at the bakery.  What did I do wrong??  Never had a pumpkin pie filling do that before. ‚òÖ Hi Sherry, were your dairy products expired perhaps? Did the filling look curdled before pouring into the par-baked crust? My family  loved this pie filling. I successfully substituted Coconut palm sugar for the brown sugar by adding about 2 tablespoons of molasses to the 1 1/4 cups of coconut Sugar. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Hands down, the BEST pumpkin pie recipe! This is my go-to pumpkin pie and it always gets rave reviews! The pie crust is insanely flakey and delicious too! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Made this pumpkin pie for the first time after using the one on the back of the can for 40 years.  Very good although I am not sure I could tell much difference.  The one thing I always have issues with is the measurement by weight rather than volume.  I know weight is supposed to me more accurate but when I try to compare the two measurements they are never even close!  Brown sugar is a great example.  Not much margin for error since brown sugar is packed into a measuring cup rather that different scooping methods for flour.  I first measured by weight for this recipe.  But when I took that same amount and tried to pack it into my measuring cups it was not even close.  No matter how tightly I packed it there was a huge amount left over ‚Äì which seemed like too much.  So I split the difference but felt it was still a little too sweet.  On another recipe (chocolate chip mocha cake) I did the same experiment.  I fluffed up the flour and then scooped and leveled.  Volume by weight was much more flour ‚Äì and my cake came out too dry.  Guess I will stick with volume measurements as weights seem all over the place.

You\'ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below ‚Äî but here\'s a brief overview of what you can expect: ‚ÄúThis is not only the perfect pumpkin pie recipe, it‚Äôll be the easiest one you make all year,‚Äù says culinary producer and test kitchen expert Nicole McLaughlin. Here are some of her best tips and tricks for perfecting this easy recipe: Blind baking refers to baking pie crust, either partially or completely, without filling it. Why would you do this? Pie with a custard-based filling, such as pumpkin, generally requires little oven time, which means you may want to give your crust a bit of a head start to ensure you don\'t end up with a raw, soggy bottom. Several reviewers suggest blind baking the pie crust in the recipe, particularly if you\'re using a homemade pie crust. Learn step-by-step how to blind bake a pie crust, whether store-bought or homemade. If you\'re using a frozen pie crust, you can often find instructions for blind baking on the package. Allrecipes Video Note that this recipe calls for canned pumpkin, not "pumpkin pie filling," which is already spiced. If you plan to use the spices and sweeteners called for in this recipe, go for unflavored canned pumpkin. While there\'s no shame in using canned pumpkin, some folks prefer the flavor and satisfaction you get from using fresh pumpkin. If that\'s you, use this recipe for making pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 ¬Ω-pound pumpkin yields about 2 cups mashed pumpkin, the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree. Several reviewers call out using ready-made pumpkin pie spice ‚Äî a combination of ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and sometimes cloves and mace ‚Äî and additional cinnamon in place of the spices called for: "I followed a suggestion that someone else had made and used 2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and 2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead," says reviewer Devin. Some folks prefer the taste of the store-bought pumpkin pie spice to the individual spices, but ultimately it\'s a matter of personal preference (and convenience!). Yes, pumpkin pie needs to be stored in the refrigerator as it is an "egg rich pie," according to the USDA. Do allow your pie ample time to cool before refrigerating it (this will also give the filling time to set), but don\'t leave it out at room temperature for more than 2 hours, otherwise there\'s a risk of bacteria growth. Pumpkin pie will last up to three to four days in the fridge. If you plan to make pumpkin pie in advance, we\'d suggest making it one to two days in advance and refrigerating ‚Äî this way you\'ll still have a couple days for leftovers, too! Custard-based pies freeze remarkably well, so you can absolutely make pumpkin pie ahead of time and freeze it for up to one month in advance (hello, stress-free holidays). If you go this route, we do suggest baking your pie in an aluminum pie pan. To freeze pumpkin pie, bake your pie and allow it to cool completely. Then wrap it in several layers of plastic wrap, and follow with an additional layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to one month. When you\'re ready to serve, remove the aluminum foil and allow the pie to defrost overnight in the refrigerator. Cracked pie? Whipped cream to the rescue! Use homemade or store-bought whipped cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon to cover any imperfections on your pie. To make homemade whipped cream, follow this top-rated whipped cream recipe. "Outstanding flavor and very easy to make. Two combinations I love," says reviewer TaoWine. "I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture," suggests reviewer MadameD. "Also, if you are using a homemade pie crust, I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling."
